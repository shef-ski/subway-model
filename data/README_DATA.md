# Data Processing

describe what the .R data processing files do exactly; what are the inputs and outputs respectively? A general summary is enough, not too much detail # TODO


# Example

The `data/` folder currently has a selection for the [IND Crosstown Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IND_Crosstown_Line#cite_note-ridership-1) (Letter: "G", Color: light green). Its approximate layout can be viewed on [this map](https://urbanrail.net/am/nyrk/new-york.htm) for example.
